What I learned
I learned how to create a responsive card layout using Flexbox. One interesting part was overlaying a color on the image using background-blend-mode: multiply, which added the desired purple tint without using extra HTML elements. I also practiced centering layouts across all screen sizes, especially wide screens like 2560px.

Continued development
I want to keep improving my layouts on ultra-wide screens and make better use of relative units instead of hardcoding heights. I also plan to explore more about dynamic viewport units like svh and dvh to make things more adaptable.
